Teen Risk and Health Data in Maine
================
by Ella Reilich Godino and Leo Van Ummersen 

## Summary

For our project we worked with a data set called "Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System," collected by the CDC. This data set looks at demographics and behaviors in teenagers from 9-12th grade across the country. According to the CDC the intent of this data is to "determine how often unhealthy behaviors occur, assess whether unhealthy behaviors increase, decrease, or stay the same over time, and provide data comparing different groups of adolescents. The data is collected through surveys given to students at both public and private high schools across the US." Due to the size of the data set, we are looking at data from Maine only in the year 2017. We also isolated out specific behaviors to look at. The original data set is massive and the filtered data set for the state of Maine alone has 188,760 observations, and 41 total variables. Becuase the respondants are all minors confidentiality is an important ethical concern. We believe the data is too large to identify people and the collection progress through an anonymous survey was effective at protecting people's identity. 

We chose this data set because we are both interested in harm reduction and wanted to understand more about youth behaviors relating to drugs and alcohol. 

Our overarching question is asking what observable patterns, if any, exist within teen behaviors relating to identity markers. We specifically looked at behaviors related to nicotine use, alcohol use, and physical activity. Because we are looking at variables like identity markers it is important to remember that correlation doesnâ€™t equal causation.

White students comprise the majority of this data at about 80% of the sample size with 6765-7015 respondents per question, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders are massively underrepresented with only 17-19 respondents per question and did not have a risk data percentage so we did not include it in the graph looking at the overall risk percentage for risky alcohol use. This reflects the demographics in Maine as a whol; according to the 2020 census Maine is 93% white.

Over half of all students except for Asian and Black or African American students have ever drunk alcohol. Binge drinking is most common in Latino students and not represented in Asian students. Between 10-23% of students had their first drink of alcohol before the age of 13, and between 7-29% of students currently drink alcohol.

When looking at nicotine use we saw that less then 20% of the students in our data set have used some form of nicotine product, while only 5% smoke on a daily basis. This number is closer to 3% among 9th graders and 7% among 12th graders. 

When looking at physical activity we saw that over 75% of students report daily physical activity, which was a surprisingly high number to us. For further analysis it would be helpful to know what types of physical activity was being reported and the duration of the activity. We also found that students appear to get more active as they progress in grade. 

To summarize what we learned from this project and the aforementioned findings-- we found that most students surveyed do not engage in risky behaviors. Although between 20-50 percent of students have tried nicotine or alcohol the percentage who report using these substances regularly is closer to 3-7% for nicotine and 7-20% for alcohol. The other main finding is that a large portion of students seem to engage in regular physical activity.

Our analysis was limited by the challenges of working with our specific data set. It is also highly likely that some students did not feel comfortable answering questions about illegal activity ie. substance use. The data set also does not specify what high schools are included in the survey, and weather or not rural areas are surveyed as frequently as more populated areas.  Socioeconomic information being included in the data set could give more clarity as to who and potentially why people are ending up engaging in high risk behaviors. This data set is super effective at looking at behavior patterns of teenagers overall, but doesn't allow for much analysis beyond that.

For future work we would like to incorporate other data and variables into our analysis. We would also like to look at locations other than Maine, to get a greater diversity in the respondents. With more time we would also explore visualizations other than bar plots.
